# The Need for Energy-Efficient Machine Learning: A Review
#### By Tom Potter

### Abstract

The field of machine learning offers significant potential in delivering computational innovations across science and industry, with cutting-edge systems using advanced methods, such as deep neural networks, to improve performance across the board every year. However, much of this work strives for competitive performance on global leaderboards without considering consequences further afield. This has led to today's models inflicting a significant environmental, financial, and social cost. The subsequent review consolidates these impacts, describing the current issues surrounding machine learning systems; suggested hardware and software solutions aiming to minimise this cost are then explored, demonstrating how the energy efficiency and sustainability of advanced machine learning models can be improved.
